                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. CSS basics takes you through
                what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I
                make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with
                background images and colors?

        <section class="main-section" id="So_what_is_CSS,_really?">
            <header>So what is CSS, really?</header>
            <p>
                Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a markup language either â€” it is a style
                sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents. For
                example, to select all the paragraph elements on an HTML page and turn the text within them red, you'd
                write this CSS:
            </p>
            <code>
                p { <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                } <br>
            </code>
            <p>
                Let's try it out: paste those three lines of CSS into a new file in your text editor, and then save the
                file as <span><em>style.css</em></span> in your <span><em>styles</em></span> directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we still need to apply the CSS to your HTML document. Otherwise, the CSS styling won't affect how
                your browser displays the HTML document. (If you haven't been following on with our project, read
                Dealing with files and HTML basics to find out what you need to do first.)
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Open your file and paste the following line somewhere in the head (that is, between the
                    <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span> tags):
                    <code>
                        &lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Save <span>index.html</span> and load it in your browser. If your paragraph text is now red,
                    congratulations! You've just written your first successful CSS. <br>

            <h3>
                Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's look at the above CSS in a bit more detail:
            </p>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png" alt="Anatomy of a CSS ruleset">
            <p>The whole structure is called a <strong>rule set</strong> (but often "rule" for short). Note also the
                names of the individual parts:</p>
            <h4>Selector</h4>
            <p>The HTML element name at the start of the rule set. It selects the element(s) to be styled (in this case,
                elements). To style a different element, just change the selector.</p>
            <h4>Declaration</h4>
            <p>A single rule like specifying which of the element's properties you want to style.
                Properties</p>
            <h4>Properties</h4>
            <p>Ways in which you can style a given HTML element. (In this case, <span>color</span> is a property of the
                <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in your rule.
            </p>
            <h4>Property value</h4>
            <p>
                To the right of the property after the colon, we have the property value, which chooses one out of many
                possible appearances for a given property (there are many <span>color</span> values besides
                <span>red</span>).
            </p>
            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each rule set (apart from the selector) must be wrapped in curly braces (<span>{}</span>).</li>
                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (<span>:</span>) to separate the property from its
                    values.</li>
                <li>Within each rule set, you must use a semicolon (<span>;</span>) to separate each declaration from
                    the next one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So to modify multiple property values at once, you just need to write them separated by semicolons, like
                this:
            </p>
            <code>
                    p { <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                        width: 500px; <br>
                        border: 1px solid black; <br>
                      } <br>
            </code>

            <h3>Selecting multiple elements</h3>
            <p>You can also select multiple types of elements and apply a single rule set to all of them. Include
                multiple selectors separated by commas. For example:</p>
            <code>
                    p, li, h1 { <br>
                        color: red; <br>
                      } <br>
            </code>

            <h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
            <p>There are many different types of selectors. Above, we only looked at element selectors, which select all
                elements of a given type in the given HTML documents. But we can make more specific selections than
                that. Here are some of the more common types of selectors.</p>

        </section>
        <hr>

        <section class="main-section" id="Fonts_and_Text">
            <header>Fonts and Text</header>
            <p>Now that we've explored some CSS basics, let's start adding some more rules and information to our
                <span>style.css</span> file to make our example look nice. Let's start by getting our fonts and text to
                look a little better.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p> First of all, go back and find the output from Google Fonts that you stored somewhere safe. Add
                        the <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> element somewhere inside your <span>index.html</span>'s head
                        (again, anywhere between the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span> tags).
                        It'll look something like this:</p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This code links your page to a stylesheet that downloads the Open Sans font family along with
                        your web page and enables you to set it on your HTML elements using your own style sheet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but red text
                    doesn't actually look very good.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add the following lines in its place, replacing the placeholder line with the actual font-family
                        line you got from Google Fonts. (font-family just means the font(s) you want to use for your
                        text.) This rule first sets a global base font and font size for the whole page (since <html> is
                        the parent element of the whole page, and all elements inside it inherit the same font-size and
                        font-family): </p>
                    <code>
                            html { <br>
                                font-size: 10px; <br>
                                font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;  <br>
                              } <br>
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Now we'll set font sizes for text-containing elements inside the HTML body. We'll also center
                        the text of our heading and set some line height and letter spacing on the body content to make
                        it a bit more readable:</p>
                    <code>
                            h1 { <br>
                                font-size: 60px; <br>
                                text-align: center; <br>
                              } <br>
                              <br>
                              p, li { <br>
                                font-size: 16px;     <br>
                                line-height: 2; <br>
                                letter-spacing: 1px; <br>
                              } <br>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        You can adjust these <span>px</span> values to whatever you like to get your design looking how
                        you want, but in general your design should look like this:
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9447/website-screenshot-font-small.png"
                        alt="mozilla is cool">
                </li>

            </ol>
        </section>
        <hr>

        <section class="main-section" id="Boxes,_boxes,_it's_all_about_boxes">
            <header>Boxes, boxes, it's all about boxes</header>
            <p>
                One thing you'll notice about writing CSS is that a lot of it is about boxes â€” setting their size,
                color, position, etc. Most of the HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top
                of each other.
            </p>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9441/boxes.jpg" alt="boxes">
            <p>
                Not surprisingly, CSS layout is based principally on the box model. Each of the blocks taking up space
                on your page has properties like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>padding</span>, the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>border</span>, the space around the outside of the element.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>margin</span>, the space around the outside of the element.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9443/box-model.png" alt="padding margin border">
            <p>In this section we also use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>width</span> (of an element).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>background-color</span>, the color behind an element's content and padding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>color</span>, the color of an element's content (usually text).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>text-shadow</span>, sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>display</span>: sets the display mode of an element (don't worry about this yet).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                    So, let's get started and add some more CSS to our page! Keep adding these new rules to the bottom of the page, and don't be afraid to experiment with changing values to see how it turns out.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Changing the page color
            </h4>
            <code>
                    html { <br>
                        background-color: #00539F; <br>
                      } <br>
            </code>
            <p>This rule sets a background color for the whole page. Change the color code above to whatever color you chose when planning your site.</p>
<h4>Sorting the body out</h4>
<code>
        body { <br>
            width: 600px; <br>
            margin: 0 auto; <br>
            background-color: #FF9500; <br>
            padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; <br>
            border: 5px solid black; <br>
          } <br>
</code>
    <p>
            Now for the <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> element. There are quite a few declarations here, so let's go through them all one by one:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>width: 600px;</span> - this forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>margin: 0auto;</span> - When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side (make it 0 in this case), and the second value the left and right side (here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right). You can also use one, three, or four values, as documented here.
        </li>

    </ul>
